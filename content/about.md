We offer all the usual types of treatment that most people need to keep their mouths, teeth and gums healthy. This includes check-ups, scaling, X-rays, fillings and extractions. Further details are available on the treatment pages

Both NHS and private treatments are available at this practice. The NHS provides any basic treatment which is necessary to secure and maintain your oral health. There are some cosmetic or more complex treatment options which may not be offered or available under the NHS. You may choose to have these treatments provided privately in addition to or as an alternative to NHS treatment. We are happy to discuss these options with you once your teeth have been examined. If you would like to be a private patient, please tell the dentist beforehand.

The ground floor premises are generally suitable for disabled patients including those in wheelchairs. If you are disabled or have any special needs, fears or worries, please tell us and we will do our best to help. If there is anything at all which you are not sure about and would like advice please do not hesitate to ask.
