Today is the start of the new NHS year and as always there are some changes to advise our patients. Firstly for any courses of treatment starting from today, new NHS charges will apply. These are:

- Band 1: £18.80
- Band 2: £51.30
- Band 3: £222.50

Also today, we see the introduction of a new feedback system called the Friends and Family Test. At the end of a course of treatment, patients will be asked to fill in a card asking: “How likely are you to recommend our dental practice to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment?” All responses are anonymous.

Results will be collected by the practice and reported to the NHS monthly and we will be given a score.
