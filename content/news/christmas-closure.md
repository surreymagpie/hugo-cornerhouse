This article is to provide information to our patients about the practice's closure for business over the holiday period.

Mr Ryatt's last working day will be this Friday, 20 December. Mr Curtis will work as normal up until close of business on Monday 23 December. He will then be available for emergency appointments only on a first-come, first-served basis on the morning of the 24th. We will be reopening after the New Year on Thursday, 2 January 2014 at our normal time of 8:30 am.

While we are closed, we have arranged with Harmoni healthcare to cover any urgent treatment needs. Patients who feel they need urgent care should call the NHS 111 helpline. They will triage you and pass your details on to Harmoni if they agree you need help. Patient's should be aware that they will be charged for any urgent treatment they receive from Harmoni.

We wish all our patients a very happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year.
