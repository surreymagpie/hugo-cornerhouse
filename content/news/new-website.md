So work on the new website is coming along well.

The basic structure and theming is pretty well all in place now and it appears to be functioning as expected. It remains for me to format the feedback page to something more even and rebuild the Facebook and Twitter links.
Also, how best to classify and display treatment information pages and add the main menu link for that.

Still looks ok for a few days work... :)
