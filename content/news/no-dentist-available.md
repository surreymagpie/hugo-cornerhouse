Patients are advised that there will be a number of days this summer where there will be no dentists available at the practice. The dates in question are as follows:

- Friday, 27th June 2014 (1 day)
- Monday, 4th August to Friday, 8th August 2014 (5 days)

We are sorry that we will be unable to provide any service on these dates but both dentists have commitments which cannot be altered. All patients who originally had appointments on these days have been contacted to reschedule. The practice will still be open and reception staff will be able to deal with enquires.

We have arranged with Virgin Care to provide cover for emergency situations in the same way that they cover the Christmas period. Patients who do require urgent assistance should call 111 to be directed to another provider.
