Prabhdeep qualified from the University of Manchester in 2008, gaining his BDS, after which he carried out Vocational Training in South East London for one year. He then worked in a family practice in Reading for two years before joining the friendly team at Cornerhouse Dental Practice.

During his dental career, he has always tried to keep up to date with current and new concepts in dentistry by attending conferences and seminars. In 2011, he gained the postgraduate MJDF qualification. His approach to dentistry is to motivate patients to achieve a high standard of oral health as he is a strong believer in prevention rather than cure.

In his spare time, he enjoys going to the gym, listening to music and watching movies.
